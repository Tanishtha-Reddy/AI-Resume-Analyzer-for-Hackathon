# AI Resume Relevance Checker

**Built for Code4EdTech Hackathon Challenge by Innomatics**

An AI-powered web application to analyze resumes against job descriptions (JDs), providing relevance scores, skill matches, and improvement suggestions. Designed for placement and recruiting teams to streamline candidate evaluation.
